# Pyspark Tutorial
This is a Pyspark Tutorial from Ryerson Data Analytics program. 
Took the .pdf of the labs and assignments for simplier learning experience.
This was also a great opportunity to learn about Google Colabs: the env was installed and run.

*upload the necessary files onto colabs to run the codes!
 
Instructions
a) upload the .ipynb file to Google Colabs
b) once Colabs is loaded, there will be a prompt somewhere in the coding to upload the .csv and .txt files
