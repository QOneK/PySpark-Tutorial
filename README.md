# Pyspark Tutorial
This is a Pyspark Tutorial from Ryerson Data Analytics program. 

Took the .pdf of the labs and assignments for simplier learning experience.

This was also a great opportunity to learn about Google Colabs: the env was installed and run.

*upload the necessary files onto colabs to run the codes!
